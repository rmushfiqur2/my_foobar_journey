# _My Foobar journey_
During normal google search, Google may surprise you by inviting to the Foobar coding challenge.

## _How it happened to me ?_

On 23 February 2022, I was busy with my PhD applications on signal processing and computer vision. All of a sudden I received an invitation from Google to participate in the Google Foobar challenge. I heard about the Foobar challenge earlier. It is a coding challenge with 5 stages of increasing difficulty. After accepting the challenge, I found in some blogs that they found level 4 as the most difficult one. In my case, I enjoyed every bit of the problems of all stages, but level 5 was a gem. It took me a full day to crack the problem. But then it didn't pass all the hidden test cases, as my solution was an exponential time solution. Again I had to think for hours to convert the solution to a polynomial (linear) time solution with dynamic programming and matrix transpose. Once I did that, Foobar showed this cool animation on my screen.

One thing I forgot to mention: the problem starts with a Sci-Fi story. You are the central characater of the plot. As the storyline advacnces, you are given more and more tasks for acheiving your goal in the Sci-Fi plot. Not to firighten you; at a stage of level 4, I was given a task which resulted into the mass destruction of a planet according to the stroyline!

## _Expected types of problems_

WIthin the entire challenge I had to solve total 9 problems from different domain. Foobar gives you enough time to read, learn and then implement. Many of the concepts here I learnt after getting the problem from foobar.

| Level | Content | Porblems |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | Power, Modulo, Division | 1 |
| 2 | Number theory, Loop | 2 |
| 3 | Cycles, Markov Model, Linear Equations | 3 |
| 4 | Priority Queue, Number sequence, Discrete math | 2 |
| 5 | Dynamic programming, Matrices, DFS, Complex probability | 1|

## _What I read_

As I hinted earlier, I got a problem and googled the necessary concepts. The problems up to level 3 can be expected during programming interview. But problems from level 4 and 5 are far complex. Actually, I read some algorithms from the book **"Introduction to algorithms"** by Thomas H Cormen (3rd edition) before attempting the level 4 problems. And I think those concpets helped me implicitly. At level 3 and 4 I got help from the below materials:

1. [How to Find a Stable 3x3 Matrix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZENBQj2qQ2k)
2. [Markov Chain, Hitting probabilities](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~fewster/325/notes/ch8.pdf)
3. [Priority queue, Binary heap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/priority-queue-using-binary-heap/)
